# Malware Detection Tool for IoT Devices

## Overview
  This project focuses on developing a tool for detecting malware in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. As IoT devices become increasingly integrated into daily life and infrastructure, ensuring their security is crucial. The proposed system aims to provide an effective solution to detect and mitigate malware attacks in IoT environments.

## Features
  ** Cross-Platform Compatibility **: Currently supported on Debian, with plans to extend to other platforms.
  User Authentication: Users can change passwords and usernames.
  Real-Time Alerts: Updates to notify users if an attack is in progress.
  Optimized Code: Improved response times for better performance.
  Public Blacklists: Release of blacklists to the public for enhanced security.
  
## System Design
  ### Architecture
    The system is designed with a modular architecture, including the following components:
      Sensor: Captures data from IoT devices.
      Server: Processes data and detects anomalies.
      Reporting Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and management.

## Diagrams
  Use Case Diagrams: Illustrate interactions between users (admin/client) and the system.
  Data Flow Diagrams: Show the flow of data within the system.
  Activity Diagrams: Represent the workflow of different processes.
  Sequence Diagrams: Detail the sequence of operations in the system.

## Implementation
  Sensor Configuration: The sensor component captures data from IoT devices.
  Server Implementation: The server processes the captured data to detect anomalies.
  Reporting Interface: Displays alerts and logs in a user-friendly format.
  Real-Life Cases: Demonstrates the effectiveness of the system in real-world scenarios.

## Testing
  Unit Testing: Tests individual components.
  Integration Testing: Ensures different components work together.
  User Testing: Validates the system with end-users.
  Load Testing: Assesses system performance under stress using tools like Locust.

## Snapshots
  Login Page: User authentication interface.
  Main Page: Dashboard displaying system status.
  Threat Analysis: Graphical representation of detected threats and their severity.
  IP Tracking: Logs showing IP addresses of potential threats.
  Filter Interface: Allows filtering data based on various parameters.

## Conclusion
  IoT devices, with their increasing complexity and functionality, are becoming targets for sophisticated malware attacks. This project aims to provide a robust solution to detect and mitigate such threats, ensuring the security of IoT environments.

## Future Enhancements
  Cross-Platform Support: Extend support to other operating systems.
  Public Release of Blacklists: Share blacklists with the public for better threat management.
  Enhanced User Features: Allow users to change their credentials and receive real-time attack notifications.
  Code Optimization: Improve the response time and performance of the system.
